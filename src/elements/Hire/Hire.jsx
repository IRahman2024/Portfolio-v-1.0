                You should hire me because I’m driven by challenges and eager to turn them into opportunities for growth. While I’m a fresher, I’ve demonstrated the ability to adapt quickly and lead projects in my academic and personal work. For example, in a recent project, I took charge of optimizing a web application that improved user experience significantly.
                <br /><br />

                Additionally, my academic background and hands-on experience in tech have equipped me with fresh insights and the ability to learn quickly, which I’m confident will help me excel in this role.
